            <p>I’ve always had a love for learning and understanding how things work and while I attended BSU for
              Psychology, I found a passion for human-computer interaction and human factors. These two practices look
              at how people interact with technology and utilize tools. After graduating, I found myself working at an
              environmental testing laboratory since I had over 5 years of experience in qualitative and quantitative
              research. The software we used was made in the 80’s and the last patch released for it was in 1998, so
              we’re working with some pretty prehistoric software. I had worked with similar software during my
              internship in college. It was fascinating to me that I could input information into the computer, and it
              would just go off somewhere into the abyss, and that was it. I’d never taken the time before to think
              about what was happening “under the hood”. As time went on, I became more and more curious about how
              something like this gets built. Finally, I couldn’t help myself and needed to know. I attended CodeWorks
              shortly after and have continued to feed my curiosity. Why not get into a practice that allows me to
              pursue my passions of studying people and solving complex problems with data driven solutions? </p>
            <p>Thanks to that leap of faith, I’ve gotten to work with various tools for web design and development. I
              love working in full-stack development with Vue, a framework similar to React and Angular, and both
              JavaScript and C# for back-end data control. I enjoy building something from the ground up and have spent
              a lot of time working in teams with other developers to enhance prior code into fully functional web
              pages. I was the Product Owner for a data management application with a team of 3 other developers. We all
              had a passion for trivia and wanted to make an application that would update in live time. It was a lot of
              fun, and we faced a lot of challenges that we didn’t anticipate, but we pulled together to communicate how
              to solve our problem. It was one of the most rewarding opportunities I had, working with a great team and
              building something we were passionate about. </p>
            <p>As someone who has worked on both the management side of development and the development team, I have a
              great understanding of the production process. Whether it’s utilizing Scrum and Agile practices when
              leading the team, or troubleshooting unexpected bugs in testing, my skills make me a great candidate for a
              team who collaborates together through the problem solving process. With my science and coding background,
              I bring versatility to the team in both critical thinking and creative problem solving by communicating
              with my team. With my passion to learn, I love to add value to everything I do. </p>
